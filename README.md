## Vine Helper
### Enhance the Amazon Vine browsing experience

<hr/>

## About
Whenever you check a category, Vine Helper determines which items are new since the last time you checked and displays them at the top of the page.
Vine helper also allows you to search the current category for items.

## Planned Features
- Routinely poll categories to check for new items, and notify user of new items that match specified keywords
- Search functionality has to be limited since queries are paginated, so there needs to a way to query an entire category in one (or at least fewer) request
- Show estimated time remaining to query items in category
- Show different message for new items when category was not previously indexed

### Disclaimer
Vine Helper is _not_ a bot and does not automatically purchase / order items. It is only a tool to enhance the _browsing_ experience for users.
